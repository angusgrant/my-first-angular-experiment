<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio Site!</h2>
<p>
  This site is a work in progress and is written in Angular 7. The latest iteration of Angular at the time of writting.
</p>

<p>
  The Portfolio navigation links are loaded dynamically from a JSON file. My next step is to retrieve them from some sort of data store.
   I have taken advantage of Routing for the naviagtion.

  The background Circle pattern is a dynamically osollating pattern drawn on the HTML5 Canvas elements. The layout is different each time the page is loaded!
