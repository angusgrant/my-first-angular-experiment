<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio Site!</h2>
<p>
  This site is a work in progress and is written in Angular 7. The latest iteration of Angular at the time of writting.
</p>

<p>
  The Portfolio navigation links are loaded dynamically from a JSON file. My next step is to retrieve them from some sort of data store.
   I have taken advantage of Routing for the page navigation.

<p>
  The background circle pattern is a drawn on to a HTML5 canvas element it is taking advantage of the 
  <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-timer" target="_blank">D3 timer</a> animation loop to create the movement.
   It uses composition multiply option to allow the circle 
  colours to combine when they cross (which creates a more attractive animation). The layout is randomly generated each time the page is loaded!
</p>

<p>
The navigation layout uses flexbox and the layout is taking advantage of the bootstrap 3 framework.
